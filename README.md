This is a tool to test and try out COM and ActiveX objects native to Windows. It is mainly educational, just to get a refresher on C++, native windows programming and ATL.
Should be supported on Windows 11 and most prior versions of NT based windows back to around 1996.  Probably will stay supported until Windows is completely rewritten.

I nice goal would be to instantiate the spell checker and use it to check spelling.

Current state:

Objects that support IDispatch can be instantiated and the members listed.  Only objects with a UI and IDispatch support have been tested.
That's it.  You can't yet call methods.
